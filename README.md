Prayer times for all local mosques


## Raw CSV Data

The `raw-csv-data` folder basically holds CSV monthly prayer times data for multiple mosques. This was manually downloaded from a website.


## Five Prayers Org

Some mosques have their data on `fiveprayers.org`. This folder has a script that helps us download and parse that data.
